      <description>Back in May (2023), Meta released their Massively Multilingual Speech Model [github]. This model is significant because it includes 1,107 languages, including a vast number of low resource languages. And supposedly it has lower error rates for transcription than OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s Whisper model.
For text-to-speech capabilities, the model actually reuses another library in Meta&amp;rsquo;s Fairseq toolkit, VITS, which was released back in June of 2021. VITS came with some pretty impressive TTS demos, and so I wanted to see how well they worked in my own hands and compare the new MMS and the older VITS models.</description>

      <description>Since LangChain seems like a fairly powerful way to recursively call OpenAI LLMs, I wanted to understand how this dark magic worked. I came accross this gist by @virattt where he creates a simple chatbot to chat with a Facebook earnings PDF. This seemed like a good place to start.
I created my own adaptation that reproduces the simple chatbot, but this time talking with the Tesla Q1 2023 earnings deck.</description>
